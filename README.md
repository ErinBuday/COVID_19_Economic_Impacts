Impact on Global Markets
==
 * This section reads in CSV files of data from 11 major stock indices in the US, Europe and Asia between 12/31/2019 and 5/06/2022. Using the Opening and Closing values of each index, the rate of daily change in terms of percentage is calculated. The rate of change will indicate how quickly the markets rise or fall during the period and it is put in terms of percentage to account for differences in market volume and currencies. The data is then smoothed using a rolling average with a window of 10 and the average rate of change was calculated for the indices in the different regions.
 * By plotting this data in a line graph for the Initial Outbreak and the Omicron Variant, we can see that the magnitudes of the peaks and troughs for the average rates of change has decreased, indicating that the global market has become less responsive to the new variants. Furthermore, by creating a bar graph with the maximum rate of loss for each region during each of the major variants of COVID-19 (Alpha, Gamma, Delta and Omicron) and the initial outbreak, we can see that the magnitudes are smaller with the exception of the US and Asian markets during the Omicron variant. This further points to the global markets being less sensitive after the initial outbreak.

Impacts on Virtual vs. In Person Fitness Stocks
==
 * This section reads in CSV files of data from Yahoo! Finance histrorical data for Peloton and Planet Fitness as well as data for COVID-19 disease designation and vaccine rollout dates from 12/31/19-5/6/22.  

Impacts on US Airline Stocks
==
 * Analysis on Delta and United Airline closing stocks values compared against vaccines rollout dates.

Impacts on Bitcoin
==
 * These analyses leverage Yahoo! Finance BTC-USD price data between 09/17/2022 - 05/09/2022. The close price was used for both analyses. The first analysis involves comparing the close price to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Data was collected when close price was below the 200-day SMA, and a bar graph was created to compared annual price when below the 200-day SMA on a percentage basis. An analysis on intra-year close price was also conducted for the years impacted by COVID-19 (2020, 2021, 2022). Percentage price changes were visualized in a line graph with vertical dotted lines indicating key dates when variants became public knowledge. The plot was used to determine if key dates impacted price trends.
 
Conclusions
==
1. Has the global market become less sensitive to the discovery of COVID-19 variants?
Is there a regional difference?
 * For the majority of the variants of concern, yes.
 * Omicron is an exception for the US and Asian markets but not the the European
markets.
2. How has the emergence of COVID-19, associated variants and vaccine rollouts
impacted virtual and in-person fitness stocks?
 * Based on the data people prefer in person fitness over virtual.
3. Impact of COVID-19 on Airline industry?
 * From the analysis, it appears that due to COVID, the stocks went down and each
time the vaccine came out the stocks tend to go up.
4. What was the impact on Bitcoin’s annual and intra-year performance?
 * The analyses conducted do not reflect a clear impact from COVID-19 and its
variants on Bitcoin’s price action.
